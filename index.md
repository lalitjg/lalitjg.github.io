# Lalit Ghule – AI Research and Development

I’m Lalit, a Senior AI Researcher at [Ansys (now part of Synopsys)](https://www.ansys.com/). I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021 and have spent my career building advanced machine-learning systems for scientific and engineering applications. My work spans deep-learning–based PDE modeling, geometric and mesh-aware learning, digital twins, NLP for technical workflows, and physics-guided optimization.

I work end-to-end across research, engineering, and productization—designing models, implementing scalable training pipelines, and integrating them into production-grade simulation tools. I primarily work in Python and PyTorch, with a strong focus on clarity, robustness, and performance.

I love running, bouldering, hiking, and recently got into outdoor rock climbing. If you know any interesting spots, hit me up!
