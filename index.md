# Lalit Ghule – AI Research Scientist

I’m Lalit, a Senior AI Researcher at Ansys (now part of Synopsys). I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021 and have spent my career building advanced machine-learning systems for scientific and engineering applications. My work spans deep-learning–based PDE modeling, geometric and mesh-aware learning, digital twins, NLP for technical workflows, and physics-guided optimization.

I work end-to-end across research, engineering, and productization—designing models, implementing scalable training pipelines, and integrating them into production-grade simulation tools. I primarily work in Python and PyTorch, with a strong focus on clarity, robustness, and performance.
